my new file contents.

1	git add <filename>	begin tracking a file	adds a change in the working directory to the staging area; tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.
2	git commit -m "message"	log the change	changes are recorded in Git (interaction is with local repo)
3	git push	finalize the change	changes are pushed from Git (local, terminal) to GitHub (browser account, remote)
